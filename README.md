## Hi there, I'm Santiago ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
I'm a fullstack software developer currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity. With strong expertise in Java 8+, the Spring Framework, and both relational and non-relational databases, I've developed a solid foundation in software development. 

I've worked as a system administrator for about 4 years, which has equipped me with valuable experience in handling infrastructure and deployments. I also have strong knowledge in DevOps practices, enabling me to streamline development processes effectively.
